# DHT Sensor Example

In this example the microcontrollers scans for devices connected over I2C and displays them to the user on the console.

## Output

When a device has been found:
```
i2c devices found: 1
At address:  0x27
```

When no devices have been found:
```
No I2C devices found
```

## Tested
This example has been tested on the following microcontroller running MicroPython:
- ESP32 Devkit v1
- ESP32S3 (FeatherS3)
